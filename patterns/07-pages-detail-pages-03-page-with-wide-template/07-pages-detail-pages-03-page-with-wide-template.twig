  <p>Four air monitoring stations were around the Aerovox Demolition project and took daily measurements of particulate matter (dust particles) in the air. <a href="/pm-pollution">Learn more about particulate matter</a>.</p>
  <p>The results were measured in micrograms of particle per cubic meter and were shown alongside the meteorological (MET) results for the average wind speed and direction.</p>
  <p>Below is a chart that explains the color coding system for the work day messages that were made available to the surrounding communities.</p>

            <p>*NAAQS <strong>= </strong>National Ambient Air Quality Standards are based on risk to human health. The NAAQ for particulate matter (PM) is 150 ug/m3 which indicates unhealthy air quality. The unit measurements are micrograms per cubic meter ug/m3. Particulate Matter (PM), for this chart, means project-related dust may include site contaminants.</p>
            <p><strong>What do the contaminant concentrations mean?</strong></p>
            <p>The project-specific action level for PM is based on a more conservative 10 hr. time weighted average whereas EPA’s NAAQ for particulate matter is based on a 24-hr. time-weighted average.</p>
            <p>EPA is using extremely low levels to trigger additional action to prevent exposure. The action levels assume that the dust detected from the project is transporting the additional contaminants such as PCBs that cannot be detected as easily and immediately.</p>
            <p>**In this scenario, the number assumes that PCBs are the only contaminant in the PM and the levels are above the OSHA permissible exposure limit (PEL) for worker safety.</p>

  <p>It will be difficult to see the early progress as work takes place inside the building. Work crews must first remove interior material and debris and safely decommission utilities which will take several months to complete. Dismantling of the exterior structure of the building is expected to begin fall of 2011.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Rigorous air and water quality monitoring and stormwater management will take place (from runoff collected from rainfall and dust suppression). EPA oversight of the data collection and validation will ensure that the project is progressing safely.</li>
    <li>Strict air and water quality standards will be used to compare with the collected data results. Background, or currently existing, air quality measurements will be recorded prior to the start of on-site work to verify that environmental conditions are not been impacted by the demolition.</li>
    <li>Data results will be made available to the public as soon as they are available. EPA will post summaries of the data here.</li>
    <li>Real-time air quality monitors will be operating at the site to ensure worker safety and alert work crews to the presence of dust that could carry airborne contaminants. In such an event, work would stop until the source is identified and controlled, if site-related. EPA will report daily on these results here.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All exterior and interior building material and debris will be disposed off-site at appropriately licensed landfills; the building foundation will remain on-site under a protective cap. Once the demolition and capping work is completed, the State Chapter 21-E cleanup program begins.</p>
